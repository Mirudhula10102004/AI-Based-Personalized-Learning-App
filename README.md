# 🎓 AI-Based Personalized Learning App

An intelligent, adaptive learning platform powered by **AI** that personalizes lessons, quizzes, and feedback based on each learner’s pace and style.  
This project was developed as part of a **Hackathon Challenge** to redefine the e-learning experience through personalization, gamification, and inclusivity.

## 🚀 Overview

Most e-learning apps follow a one-size-fits-all approach, leading to reduced engagement and motivation.  
**AI-Based Personalized Learning App** solves this by adapting content dynamically to every learner, providing real-time feedback, and visualizing progress in an engaging, distraction-free environment.
